<b>Bots in the net - Applying Machine Learning to identify social media trolls</b><br>

**Project Description**<br>
Following the 2016 elections, the United States and the world at large noticed a disturbing phenomenon of the use of social media for malicious political influence. It was later discovered that the Internet Research Agency, Russiaâ€™s social media troll farm, spread disinformation to tens of millions of American voters using targeted tweets and Facebook posts (US, 2018).

Social media platforms and citizens alike would benefit from additional tools to detect whether posts were created by bots. In this paper, we apply Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Kernel SVM, Random Forest, and LSTM neural networks to identify political trolls across social media and compare their accuracies. Using these trained models, we build a classifier for Twitter content that predicts the likelihood a given tweet was created by a troll bot in real time. This tool can aid moderation for social media companies by flagging suspicious tweets in a live feed.
